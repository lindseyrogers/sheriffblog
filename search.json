On this map, California stands out as a state with high amounts of fatal police encounters with the rest of the country at relativly low values. This map does not account for population. Because California is a highly populated state, there may be a higher number of violence, but per capita the value may be lower.\n\n\nCode\nmpv_sorted.plot(kind = 'barh',\n                          x = 'state',\n                          y = 'percap',\n                          figsize = (8,9),\n                          color = \"lightsteelblue\", ec=\"navy\",\n                          title = 'Fatal Encounters with Police',\n                         xlabel = 'per 1,000,000 people',\n                         ylabel = 'State');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart displays the number of fatal police encounters per 1 million people by state in 2022. These values were found by dividing the amount of police violence in 2022 by the population of the state. The bar chart indicates that Missouri, Arkansas, and Iowa have the highest per capita rate of fatal police encounters. A majority of the states in the US have relativly low per capita rates of violence.\n\n\nCode\nmpv_percap = mpv_merged.set_index('state')\nmpv_percap = mpv_percap.drop('DC')\n\nq = folium.Map(location=[36, -98], zoom_start=4) \n\nbins = list(mpv_merged[\"percap\"].quantile([0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]))\n\nstate_geo = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium/master/examples/data/us-states.json\" \n\nfolium.Choropleth(\n  geo_data=state_geo,\n  data = mpv_percap['percap'],\n  key_on=\"feature.id\",\n  fill_color=\"Blues\", bins=bins\n).add_to(q)\n\n\n<folium.features.Choropleth at 0x7fcef0ef5a50>\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to display the per capita rates from the graph above is to display the data geographically. The darker colors on this map show states with higher per capita amounts of police violence. Since the distribution of per capita values is so varied, the colors on this map are shown by quartile. Similar to the graph above, Missouri, Arkansas, and Iowa stand out as states with high per capita violence. Unlike the first map, California does not stand out as a place with high violence. The New England Region on this map stands out as a region with very low per capita fatal police encounters, indicated by the lightest blue color.\n\n\n\nPolice Violence by State Per 1,000,000 People\n\n\nCode\nq\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -> Trust Notebook"

Each color represents a different type of jursdiction. Red represents state facilities, blue represents county facilities, purple represents federal facilities, and green represents immigration facilities. According to this map, there appears to be a high number of state facilites, but this number is skewed because the original dataset does not track all facilites in the United States. For example, the UCLA Behind Bars dataset only collects information on select county jail facilities, which explains the underrepresentation of county jails across the country.\n\n\nCode\nCA_covid = lfc.loc[ lfc['State'] == 'California' ]\nCA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum()\n\ndata_dict = {'State': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum(), \n             'County': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'county', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum(),\n             'Federal': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'federal', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum()}\n\n\nin_type = list(data_dict.keys())\nsums = list(data_dict.values())\n\nplt.bar(range(len(data_dict)), sums, tick_label=in_type,\n        color = \"lightsteelblue\", ec=\"navy\")\nplt.title(\"COVID Deaths in California Prisons\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Institution Type\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Deaths\");\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph was created using data from UCLA Law’s Behind Bars project. I first created a subset of data to only show California values, then created a dictionary of sums of the Covid deaths by institution type. This graph could be misleading as the values are not per capita, so though state prisons have the highest amount of Covid deaths, it also may be the most populated. I chose to focus on California because the Behind Bars dataset collects state, federal, and county data for the state of California.\n\n\nCode\ndata_percap = {'State': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum()/CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Residents.Population'].sum(), \n             'County': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'county', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum()/CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'county', 'Residents.Population'].sum(),\n            'Federal': CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'federal', 'Residents.Deaths'].sum()/CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'federal', 'Residents.Population'].sum()}\n\n\nin_type = list(data_percap.keys())\nsums = list(data_percap.values())\n\nplt.bar(range(len(data_percap)), sums, tick_label=in_type,\n        color = \"lightsteelblue\", ec=\"navy\")\nplt.title(\"COVID Deaths in California Prisons Per Capita\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Institution Type\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Per Capita Deaths\");\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph tells a very different story. When Covid deaths are calculated per capita, county jails are much more deadly with a per capita death rate of 0.006. By this measure, fedearl prisons are the least deadly with the lowest per capita rate of covid deaths. The UCLA Behind Bars dataset is in a moment of transition where they are about to start collecting all death information. Once that data is released, I would be interested in graphing this chart again and see if these trends remain consistent for all deaths in prisons.\n\n\nCode\ngroups = ['Federal', 'State', 'County']\nresident = [CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'federal', 'Residents.Confirmed'].sum(),\n           CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Residents.Confirmed'].sum(),\n           CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'county', 'Residents.Confirmed'].sum()]\nstaff = [CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'federal', 'Staff.Confirmed'].sum(),\n        CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'state', 'Staff.Confirmed'].sum(),\n        CA_covid.loc[CA_covid['Jurisdiction'] == 'county', 'Staff.Confirmed'].sum()]\n\n\nX_axis = np.arange(len(groups))\n  \nplt.bar(X_axis - 0.2, resident, 0.4, label = 'Resident', color = 'lightsteelblue', ec = 'navy')\nplt.bar(X_axis + 0.2, staff, 0.4, label = 'Staff', color = 'bisque', ec = 'darkorange')\n  \nplt.xticks(X_axis, groups)\nplt.xlabel(\"Jurisdiction\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Covid Cases\")\nplt.title(\"Covid Cases for Residents and Staff in Prisons\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nratio = [i / j for i, j in zip(staff, resident)]\nratio\n\n\n[0.0, 0.6219686948853616, 0.4342123117282555]\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart shows the number of Covid cases in Federal, State, and County prisons and jails, divided between residents and staff. This graph is not per capita because the initial dataset does not have a total count of staff at each facility. There are more Covid cases for residents because they have a higher population than staff. From this, I also calculated ratios for each jursidiction type.\n\n\nThere were no cases of Covid for Federal prison staff, so there is not a ratio. The ratio for state prisons is 0.62. The ratio for county jails is 0.43. This tells me that proportionally, more residents are getting Covid compared to the staff. This aligns with the findings of the per capita graph above that county jails are more transmissible and dangerous than state prisons."

States that have higher police violence should be examined for structural and cultural reasons that could explain the rates of violence. Similarly, states with lower police violence should also be studied to explain their low rates that could provide a model for replicating low police violence.\nCounty facilities appear to be more dangerous than other facility types, at least in terms of COVID-19 deaths. As more data is released surrounding other causes of deaths within prisons, a similar analysis should be done to prevent deaths. These trends illuminate where attention should be focused to lower danger.\nData surrounding police violence and prison safety are incomplete. Especially on the prison safety side, there is not enough data collected and published to fully explore the trends. For example, I wanted to compare COVID-19 deaths between residents and staff per capita, but the total number staff at each facility was not recorded.\n\n\n\n\nData Used\n\n\n\n\nMapping Police Violence\n\n\nUCLA Law Behind Bars\n\n\nFolium US Boundaries\n\n\nUS Census"
